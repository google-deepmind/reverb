  """Maintains a specified ratio between samples and inserts.

  The limiter works in two stages:

    Stage 1. Size of table is lt `min_size_to_sample`.
    Stage 2. Size of table is ge `min_size_to_sample`.

  During stage 1 the limiter works exactly like MinSize, i.e. it allows
  all insert calls and blocks all sample calls. Note that it is possible to
  transition into stage 1 from stage 2 when items are removed from the table.

  During stage 2 the limiter attempts to maintain the ratio
  `samples_per_inserts` between the samples and inserts. This is done by
  measuring the "error" in this ratio, calculated as:

    number_of_inserts * samples_per_insert - number_of_samples

  If `error_buffer` is a number and this quantity is larger than
  `min_size_to_sample * samples_per_insert + error_buffer` then insert calls
  will be blocked; sampling will be blocked for error less than
  `min_size_to_sample * samples_per_insert - error_buffer`.

  If `error_buffer` is a tuple of two numbers then insert calls will block if
  the error is larger than error_buffer[1], and sampling will block if the error
  is less than error_buffer[0].

  `error_buffer` exists to avoid unnecessary blocking for a system that is
  more or less in equilibrium.
